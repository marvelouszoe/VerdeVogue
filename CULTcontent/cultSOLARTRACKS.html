                <p>
                    Solar panels are being rolled out <i>“like carpet”</i> on railway tracks in Switzerland.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Swiss start-up Sun-Ways is installing panels near Buttes train station in the west of the country in May, 
                    pending sign-off from the Federal Office of Transport.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As the climate crisis demands that we speed up Europe's energy transition, developers have been seeing new 
                    potential in unusual surfaces.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Roadsides, reservoirs and farms are all finding space for solar systems. And Germany's Deutsche Bahn is also 
                    experimenting with adding solar cells to railway sleepers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But Sun-Ways is the first to patent a removable system, with the help of EPFL, the Swiss federal technology 
                    institute in Lausanne.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “That is the innovation," co-founder Baptiste Danichert tells the Swissinfo news site. And it's a crucial one 
                    since railway tracks need to be cleared from time to time for essential maintenance work.

                <img src="/culturePIC/SOLAR PANEL TRACKS/cultSOLARCARPET.2.jpg" alt="">
                <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/03/17/solar-panels-could-be-installed-in-the-spaces-between-railway-tracks-in-world-first" target="_blank">

                  </a>   
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Swiss company, based in the western town of Ecublens, has devised a mechanical system to install its removable solar panels.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A train developed by Swiss track maintenance company Scheuchzer will travel along the rails, laying photovoltaic 
                    panels as it goes. It's just “like an unrolling carpet", says Sun-Ways.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The specially designed train uses a piston mechanism to unfurl the one-metre-wide panels, pre-assembled at a Swiss 
                    factory.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Electricity produced by the PV system will be fed into the power grid and used to power homes as feeding it into 
                    railway operations would be a more complicated process.
                </p>
                <br>
                <b><p>How much energy could solar panels on railway lines produce?</p></b>
                <img src="/culturePIC/SOLAR PANEL TRACKS/cultSOLARCARPET.3.jpg" alt="">
                <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/03/17/solar-panels-could-be-installed-in-the-spaces-between-railway-tracks-in-world-first" target="_blank">
                    <span id="photographer"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i> Sun-Ways </span>
                  </a>   
                <br>
                <p>
                    The start-up has big ambitions for its eco-innovation. In theory, panels could be rolled out across the entirety 
                    of Switzerland's 5,317 kilometre-long railway network. The photovoltaic cells would cover an area around the size 
                    of 760 football fields.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Obviously, there'd be little point extending the solar carpet into tunnels.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Sun-Ways estimates the national rail network could produce one Terawatt-hour (TWh) of solar energy per year, 
                    equivalent to around 2 per cent of Switzerland's total energy consumption.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Once its train has left the station, the company wants to go transnational - extending into Germany, Austria and Italy.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    "There are over a million kilometres of railway lines in the world," Danichert tells SWI Swissinfo.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “We believe that 50 per cent of the world's railways could be equipped with our system.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The company still has a lot to prove with its pilot project near Buttes, however. The International Union 
                    of Railways has expressed concern that the panels could suffer micro-cracks, lead to a higher risk of fires in 
                    green areas and even distract train drivers with reflections.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Sun-Ways says its panels are more resistant than conventional ones and could have an anti-reflection filter to 
                    keep out of train drivers' eyes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Built-in sensors also ensure they work properly while brushes attached to the end of trains could remove dirt 
                    from the surface of the panels.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Some have pointed out that ice and snowfall could stop the horizontal panels from being useful, but Sun-Ways 
                    has an answer for this too. It is working on a system to melt frozen precipitation.
