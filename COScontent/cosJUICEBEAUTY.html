                <br>
                <p>Juice Beauty is a luxury organic skincare brand whose mission is to produce effective beauty products using natural 
                    ingredients. Its products are vegan, cruelty-free, and sustainably sourced and manufactured, and it seeks to further 
                    its positive social impact by partnering with nonprofits like the Breast Cancer Prevention Partners and the 
                    Environmental Working Group. 
                </p>

                    This Juice Beauty cosmetics review will take a deep dive into the brand, its bestselling products, customer feedback, 
                    promotions, and more so that you can better determine whether or not this brand deserves pride of place in your

                    <b><p>Overview of Juice Beauty Cosmetics </p></b>

                <br>
                <p>
                    Self-described <i>“serial wellness entrepreneur”</i> Karen Behnke launched Juice Beauty in California in 2005 after two 
                    late-age pregnancies got her thinking more seriously about the ingredients in her skincare products. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Discovering that many high-end products used ingredients that were unsafe for pregnant women, Karen set out to create 
                    organic beauty solutions that would produce even better results than conventional cosmetics.During a five-year
                     development period, she and her team of chemists, physicians, and microbiologists perfected Juice Beauty's complex, 
                     organic formulas.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The brand really hit its stride when its now-patented Green Apple Peel exfoliating mask gained popularity thanks 
                    to numerous awards and celebrity shout-outs. Beauty influencer Lauren Conrad even called it her favorite skincare mask, 
                    and a product that she can't live without. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Gwyneth Paltrow also joined the Juice Beauty fold, quite literally. Her company Goop partnered with the brand to 
                    create a line of organic Juice Beauty makeup, and Paltrow herself took on the role of creative director for the new 
                    line. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While Juice Beauty headquarters is located in San Rafael, in 2018 the brand purchased a sustainably managed vineyard 
                    in Sonoma County, the heart of California's wine region. Here, the brand grows its own supply of organic ingredients 
                    for its product line to supplement those it sources from its organic farming partners.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Juice Beauty team talks all about the farm and the process of growing natural ingredients on their blog 
                    (linked on the Juice Beauty website), along with beauty tips and skincare information.

                <h3>Juice Beauty Phyto-Pigments Flawless Serum Foundation  </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The two-in-one Phyto-Pigments Flawless Serum Foundation rolls makeup foundation and anti-aging treatment together 
                    into a perfect package. Grapeseed and fruit stem cells work to conceal fine lines and wrinkles, and, while hydrating 
                    organic aloe juice plumps and smooths your skin.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This serum comes in 13 shades, ranging from light-beige “buff” to “deep” dark brown—though unfortunately, 
                    this product is not inclusive of darker skin tones or very fair skin. Get the Phyto-Pigments Flawless Serum 
                    Foundation for $44, or subscribe and pay $42 per order (and get free shipping to boot).

                <h3>Juice Beauty Stem Cellular CC Cream  </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Stem Cellular CC Cream is a skin-enhancing color-correcting cream that does triple duty as a sunscreen and 
                    anti-aging treatment that takes the fight to your fine lines and wrinkles. Your color and tone will become even 
                    and glowing, while the all-natural, organically formulated sun protection lets you shelter your skin without the 
                    use of planet-harming chemicals. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This cream comes in seven shades, ranging from “natural glow” to “deep glow,” which means that you should be able 
                    to find something that perfectly matches your skin tone. Get the Stem Cellular CC Cream for $39, or subscribe and 
                    save 5% per order.

                <h3>Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser  </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Banish your blemishes with the Blemish Clearing Cleanser. This detoxifying face wash deeply cleans the skin with 
                    coconut extracts, while the antioxidants from organic lemon and cherry fruit acids evens your skin tone and promotes 
                    a clear, healthy glow.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This product is ideal for those with oily or acne-prone skin, as it works to flush out impurities without the 
                    irritation and redness that can result from chemically based cleansers, and keeps your skin hydrated with organic 
                    aloe. The Blemish Clearing Cleanser is $28.

                <h3>Juice Beauty Hydrating Mist  </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Hydrating Mist is a toner spray that can be used throughout the day to give much-needed moisture to your skin. 
                    You can give yourself a spritz before makeup application to tone your skin, after application in order to help the 
                    makeup set, and even on your hair or in a room for a calming and refreshing scent, as the essential oils in this 
                    product are used for aromatherapy.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Like all Juice Beauty products, the Hydrating Mist is made without any harmful ingredients like parabens, petroleum, 
                    and artificial dyes or fragrances. Vitamin-rich and hydrating, it's usable for all skin types and tones. Get it for 
                    $25, or subscribe and save.

                <h3>Juice Beauty SPF 30 Oil-Free Moisturizer   </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The SPF 30 Oil-Free Moisturizer not only gives you natural sun protection, but also helps you retain a more 
                    youthful appearance by preventing those glorious but treacherous rays from accentuating lines and wrinkles. 
                    Ideal for combination skin or those prone to oiliness or blemishes, it's best used in combination with the 
                    Blemish Clearing Cleanser.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Apply this to lightly dampened skin and you'll soon start reaping the benefits of the moisture-promoting 
                    and -retaining formula made from algae and aloe, while natural zinc oxide fends off the rays without the use of 
                    chemicals. The SPF 30 Oil-Free Moisturizer is $32, or $30 per order with a subscription—why not try it out? You 
                    can modify or cancel it at any time.

                <h3>Juice Beauty SPF 30 Sport Sunscreen  </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The SPF 30 Sport Sunscreen provides all-natural, all-ages sun protection for those who love to be outside and on the 
                    go. But this product not only shields you from the sun—it also feeds your skin the hydration and vitamins it needs 
                    thanks to the antioxidant-rich mix of coconut oil, jojoba oil, and aloe.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Use this every 80 minutes of outdoor time for maximum protection, and you can face the day (and the rays) without 
                    fear. You can get the SPF 30 Sport Sunscreen for only $18.
                </p>

                <b><p>What is Juice Beauty? </p></b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Juice Beauty is a clinically approved, organic, environmentally friendly beauty and skincare line founded by Karen 
                    Behnke. Juice Beauty is now partnered with actress Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand Goop.
                </p>

                <b><p>Does Gwyneth Paltrow own Juice Beauty?</p></b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Juice Beauty Gweneth Paltrow connection is a partnership situation, not an ownership one. Paltrow's brand Goop 
                    joined forces with Juice Beauty to produce a line of high-performance organic makeup, with Paltrow on board as 
                    creative director. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <b><p>Where is Juice Beauty made? </p></b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Juice Beauty products are made in California. The brand sources its ingredients from its own organic farm in Sonoma 
                    County, as well as from other organic farming partners.
                </p>
                <br>
                <b><p>Is Juice Beauty really organic? </p></b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    All Juice Beauty cosmetics are made with USDA-certified organic ingredients. This means that the ingredients come 
                    from farms that maintain and replenish soil fertility without the use of toxic pesticides and chemical fertilizers. 
                    Juice Beauty also does not test its products on animals during any stage of production or development, and is 
                    certified cruelty-free by Leaping Bunny. 
                </p>

                <b><p>Does Juice Beauty work?</p></b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The majority of Juice Beauty reviews are positive, stating that the products perform as advertised. Some reviewers, 
                    though, did say that they saw little to no results after a trial period, while others with sensitive skin experienced 
                    strong negative reactions.

                    It should be noted that the webpages for Juice Beauty's most powerful exfoliating products do include warnings for 
                    those with sensitive or rosacea-prone skin.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Juice Beauty products are clinically proven to nourish, hydrate, and revitalize skin. While some customers with sensitive skin experienced prolonged irritation or redness when using certain items, reactions such as these were in a very small minority.
