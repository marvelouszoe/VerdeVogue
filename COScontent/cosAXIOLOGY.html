                <h1>About Axiology</h1>
                <br>
                <p>The beauty industry is constantly growing with new options on the market seemingly every 
                    week. Unfortunately, while these new companies strive to be cruelty-free, there still 
                    aren’t many vegan options. That’s where Axiology comes in. This <b>vegan cosmetic brand</b> is 
                    known for its zero-waste lip crayons and ethical makeup standards. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>   
                    The company received the Byrdie Eco Beauty Award in 2021 and has been mentioned in Elle, Vogue, 
                    and The Oprah Magazine. They also boast <b>58.8k</b> followers on Instagram and <b>52.2k</b> on TikTok. So the 
                    small company is making some significant strides. 
                </p>
                <br> 
                <p>
                    But are their products worth the hype? By the end of this Axiology review I intend to find out. 
                    Join me as I take a deep dive into the company’s history, some of their best-sellers, customer 
                    ratings, and more so you can decide if it’s time for some new lippies. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>Overview of Axiology</h1>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Ericka Rodriguez has always been committed to animal welfare. Before launching Axiology, 
                    she realized that animal testing still exists in the beauty industry and her personal 
                    collection wasn’t entirely cruelty-free. This devastated her as a vegan and gave her the 
                    push to start her own vegan beauty brand. 
                </p>
                <br>   
                <p>
                    Rodriguez was determined to create a <b>cruelty-free, vegan lipstick</b> even though she didn’t have a background in chemistry. After more than 200 formulations, she finally arrived at a combination that worked. She and her fiancé packed up and moved to Bali to continue getting ready for the launch. 

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>They eventually settled in Bend, Oregon, becoming the location for their new company’s 
                    HQ in November 2014. Since its launch, their products can be <b>seen on shelves in Sephora 
                    and Ulta</b>, and they continue to make <b>ethical makeup</b> that doesn’t harm the animals or the 
                    Earth. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Now that you know more about the brand, I can really get this Axiology review started. But first, let’s take a look at some highlights:

                <p>The best-selling Axiology lipsticks combine lip care with beauty. 
                    The beneficial ingredients mixed with beautiful pigments make for <b>pretty and

                <p>
                    Last in this Axiology review is the Cotton Candy Skies Vegan Balmies. This bundle 
                    comes with <b>multi-use</b> nude crayons for your eyes, lips, and cheeks. They’re <b>100% zero
                    waste</b> and come wrapped in recycled paper, so you can look pretty and reduce your carbon 
                    footprint at the same time.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The Balmie crayons are made with tons of <b>nourishing oils, butter, and antioxidants</b> like 
                    hemp and plum oil to help hydrate your skin. It’s like a skincare and makeup product 
                    wrapped in one (or three!). They’ll add a sweet flush to the skin and can easily be 
                    recycled once you’ve used it all up. 
                </p>

                    Axiology Beauty is great for anyone looking for <b>vegan, cruelty-free, and skin-friendly</b> 
                    lip products. Besides having adorable nude colors and classic reds, they stick true to their 
                    core values. Anyone who follows the same lifestyle will appreciate it.

                <br>
                <p>
                    The brand could also be great for young girls just starting their beauty journey as their 
                    lippies are <b>easy to use</b> and super <b>forgiving</b>.

                    This wouldn’t be a true Axiology review if I didn’t look at what customers say about the brand. So, I searched the internet for feedback to help you make an informed decision. Besides the main website, I found some on Influenster and Makeup Alley.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The Goodness Vegan Lipstick is well-loved for its no-fuss pigment and smooth application. Customers also love the color payoff and slight shimmer. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <i><p>One reviewer wrote: “Great packaging, a lovely color that isn’t overwhelming, smooth application, and slight orange scent/taste makes this one of my favorite lipsticks. Plus, my order arrived very quickly after I purchased it.” 

                </p></i>
                <br>
                <i><p>Another customer said: “I was hesitant at first because shimmery light pinks aren’t typically my style, but I’m super happy with my purchase. It works wonderfully with warm skin tones, and the rose-quartz color is subtle and very sheer but still has a great impact. The formula is buttery soft and feels great on my lips.” 

                </p></i>
                <br>
                <p>The <b>Cotton Candy Skies Vegan Balmies</b> set also got some praise. Their pigments and nourishing benefits have reviewers happy and hopefully for more products.

                <p>One reviewer wrote: <i>“I’ve tried it on my eyes, cheeks, and lips, and I love all the options. I definitely will buy more products in the future. Feels great to have a company align with my values. Keep up the good work, Axiology. I hope you develop more products in the future.”

                </i></p>
                <br>
                <p>Beauty junkies on Influenster also can’t get enough of the brand’s vegan lipsticks. 
                    One reviewer said:<i> “This is my favorite makeup brand, especially when it comes to 
                    lipsticks. […] They are clean, non-toxic, and green, and their products last and apply 
                    beautifully. I am a sucker for this brand.” 
               </i> </p>
               <br>
               <p>Despite all of this praise in this Axiology review, I found a couple of complaints about product longevity and quality. Some customers said that the short shelf-life isn’t clearly stated and might become an issue for people who don’t wear makeup often. 
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                Another reviewer found the formula dred out their skin and noted that it might not work for them. Experiences may differ when it comes to beauty products. One size does not fit all.

               </p>
               <br>
               <p>The previous reviewer mentioned that the Axiology team responded to a comment that their product lasted for 17 months, suggesting the brand should include it in the package details. Other than that, criticisms are pretty rare concerning the brand’s service and product quality. 

               </p>

                <br>
                <p>Axiology seems pretty <b>legit</b>. Customers rave about the brand and its quick shipping, so there aren’t many red flags on that front. There might be a few growing pains, especially for a smaller brand, but I think they’re definitely prioritizing customer satisfaction.

                <br>
                <p>While cruelty-free beauty products aren’t new to the industry, finding vegan items can be more challenging than you would think. Axiology aims and succeeds in offering products that don’t have to harm animals along the way.

                <p>Based on this Axiology review, I think the brand is <b>worth checking out</b>. 
                    Their lipsticks are <b>timeless, beautiful,</b> and great for <b>everyday use or special 
                        occasions</b>. Plus, they’re beginner-friendly with buildable coverage and beneficial

                <p>Unfortunately, Axiology only ships within the United States. I’ll get into more detail in the following section.

                <br>
                <p>Axiology offers <b>free shipping</b> for orders over <b>$35</b>. If your order total is less, your 
                    shipping costs will be calculated at checkout. Once you’ve made your purchase, shipping
