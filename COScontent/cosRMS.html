                    Creator of RMS Marie Swift named the brand after the initials of her full name, Rose-Marie Swift. A well-known makeup artist
                     with decades of experience in the industry, Swift founded RMS Beauty in 2008 to provide a clean alternative to the often toxic, 
                     quick-fix makeup brands on the market.

                <br>
                <p>
                    The brand’s initials also stand for “Real Makeup Secrets” and “Right Mental State,” which speaks to RMS’ mission 
                    statement: “to create healthy luxurious beauty [using only] the highest-quality clean ingredients, meticulously 
                    sourced and tested for complete purity.” 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Some of the “Real Makeup Secrets” RMS Beauty uses to make their products include using high-quality organic oils 
                    and avoiding high heats in their manufacturing process, so that the vitamins and antioxidants within the oils are 
                    protected.

                <p>
                    Based in Charleston, South Carolina, RMS Beauty is considered a pioneer in the field of clean beauty, and RMS makeup

                <h2>RMS UnCover-Up</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Some days our skin looks perfect—there’s not a blemish in sight and we’re really feeling ourselves, no makeup required. 
                    Fast forward a few days and it’s a whole different story: dark circles and red spots appear, and we wonder how our skin 
                    could change up on us so fast. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “Un” Cover-Up camouflages those areas you’d rather the world not see, but not in the way those thick and heavy concealers do. 
                    The RMS uncover up concealer uses auto-adjusting minerals for a lightweight feel and a natural finish that lets you go about your
                    day with confidence. 

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The RMS Beauty un cover-up concealer/foundation is available in 16 shades ranging from light alabaster to rich ebony, and retails for $36. 
                </p>

                    Foundation is one of those things that many women can’t leave the house without. It provides a smooth, even look that makes us
                     look a little more kempt. Whether you like just a touch of coverage or a more pristine look, “Un” Cover-Up Cream Foundation is 
                     buildable to your preference. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Available in 16 shades, this lightweight RMS foundation contains skin-loving ingredients like organic coconut oil
                    and wild-crafted buriti oil to nourish and calm skin while. The antioxidant-packed “Un” Cover-Up Cream Foundation
